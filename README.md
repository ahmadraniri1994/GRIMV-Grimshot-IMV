# GRIMV (Grimshot + IMV)
GRIMV (Grimshot + IMV) , Combination of grimshot (take screenshot on wayland) and imv (image viewer).
I used to use grimshot to take screenshot, but I never get the preview of my screenshot, so I try to combine grimshot (as screenshot tool) and imv (as viewer of screenshot).
Here, beside as viewer, I configure an alias of imv command to do "rename" stuffs, so if I think the screenshot's filename looks weird, I can easily rename it with an alias.
Works on sway, hikari, and perhaps other wayland compositor.
